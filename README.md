# Projects

## Filesystem - *Spring 2022*
As part of an Operating Systems course at LSU, a partner and I created a working local filesystem that would need to pass various tests provided by the professor.  Below is the diagram that I created during the planning period of our project.

Due to academic honesty rules, I am not allowed to share my source code for this project.

## Mog - *Fall 2021* [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/bryantran21/Mog)

As part of a Software Systems Development course at LSU, a group of classmates and I created an all-in-one social-fitness.  The app is designed to incorporate a social media aspect to promote going to the gym and maintaining a healthy lifestyle by allowing you to join your workout friends in a group and encourages accountability among peers.  It also has other commonly-used features such as a nutrition diary and a weightlifting diary.


## Marvelous Movies Website
As part of a Networking course at LSU, I was tasked with creating a 3-Tier Website Application hosted on an EC2 Instance. 

Below is a video demo of the website that was created for class.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm - *Fall 2020* [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/theblakelalonde/theblakelalonde/tree/Dijkstra-Algorithm)
As a project in my Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course at LSU, I was tasked with creating a program using Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the quickets flight path to get from one airport to another.  We were provided a text document with +13000 flights and details and were required to use these flights to ensure our algorithm worked.

## Goober - *Spring 2021* [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/theblakelalonde/csc_3380)
As part of an Object-Oriented Deisgn course at LSU, a group of classmates and I created an app to aide pairing students needing tutors in specific classes.  In this project, I mainly worked on front-end, as well as assisted on implementing functions on the back-end.
