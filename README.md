### [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/theblakelalonde/theblakelalonde/tree/Dijkstra-Algorithm)
As a project in my Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course at LSU, I was tasked with creating a program using Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the quickets flight path to get from one airport to another.  We were provided a text document with +13000 flights and details and were required to use these flights to ensure our algorithm worked.

### [Goober](https://github.com/theblakelalonde/csc_3380)
As part of an Object-Oriented Deisgn course, a group of classmates and I created an app to aide pairing students needing tutors in specific classes.  In this project, I mainly worked on front-end, as well as assisted on implementing functions on the back-end.
