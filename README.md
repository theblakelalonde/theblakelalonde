### [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/theblakelalonde/theblakelalonde/tree/Dijkstra-Algorithm)
As a project in my Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course at LSU, I was tasked with creating a program using Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the quickets flight path to get from one airport to another.  We were provided a text document with +13000 flights and details and were required to use these flights to ensure our algorithm worked.

### [Goober](https://github.com/theblakelalonde/csc_3380)
As part of an Object-Oriented Deisgn course at LSU, a group of classmates and I created an app to aide pairing students needing tutors in specific classes.  In this project, I mainly worked on front-end, as well as assisted on implementing functions on the back-end.

### [Mog](https://github.com/bryantran21/Mog)
(In Progress)
As part of a Software-Systems Development course at LSU, a group of classmates and I created an all-in-one social-fitness.  The app was designed to incorporate a social media aspect to promote going to the gym and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  The app allows you to join your workout-friends in a group and encourages accountability among peers.  It also has other commonly-used features such as a nutrition diary and a weightlifting diary.
